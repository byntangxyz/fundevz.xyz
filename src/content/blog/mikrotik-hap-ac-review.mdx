# MikroTik hAP ac – Full Review After Buying It for Rp650,000

![hAP ac RB962UiGS-5HacT2HnT](/post/hapac.jpeg)

So yeah, I finally bought a **MikroTik hAP ac** for around **Rp650,000**, and after spending quite some time actually using it day by day, I feel like I can give a proper and honest review. This is not a spec-sheet review or first impression kind of thing. This is based on real usage, real mistakes, and real learning moments.

I’m not going to sound too formal here. This is more like sharing my experience as someone who really wants to understand networking instead of just plugging in a router and forgetting about it.

## Why I Decided to Buy the MikroTik hAP ac

The main reason I bought this router is simple: I want to seriously learn networking. Not just the surface-level stuff like changing WiFi names or setting passwords, but actual networking concepts like routing, VLANs, firewall rules, and traffic flow.

I’m also planning to build a small home server and homelab setup. For that kind of environment, consumer routers usually feel very limited. MikroTik feels more like a real networking tool that still makes sense for home use.

Cisco gear is cool and all, but for learning at home with limited budget and power consumption, MikroTik feels way more realistic.

## Specs That Actually Matter in Real Usage

On paper, the MikroTik hAP ac doesn’t look very impressive. The CPU isn’t something crazy, the RAM is only 128MB, and the design is very simple. But once you understand how RouterOS works, you realize that raw specs are not everything here.

It comes with five Gigabit Ethernet ports, dual-band WiFi (2.4GHz and 5GHz), and RouterOS Level 4 license. What really matters is how flexible and configurable everything is.

In real-world usage, this router feels way more capable than its price suggests.

## Build Quality and Design

Physically, the MikroTik hAP ac looks very plain. It’s small, lightweight, and made of plastic. There’s nothing flashy about it at all. But honestly, I like that.

It doesn’t scream “gaming router” or try too hard with RGB or aggressive shapes. It feels more like a proper networking device. The internal antennas also keep the design clean and minimal.

For me, this router feels like a tool you use to build something, not a toy you show off.

---

## Daily Performance and Stability

In daily usage, the MikroTik hAP ac has been very stable for me. Routing feels solid, latency is low, and I haven’t experienced random disconnects.

Even when used together with a small lab environment, like Proxmox, virtual machines, Docker services, and constant SSH or RDP access, the router stays stable and responsive.

For a home or learning environment, that level of stability is more than enough.

---

## WiFi Experience

WiFi performance is decent, but you shouldn’t expect miracles.

The 2.4GHz band is stable and reliable for general usage. The 5GHz band is fast enough for daily activities like streaming, browsing, and downloads. Coverage is okay for a small to medium-sized house.

If you’re expecting super long-range or ultra-fast WiFi everywhere, this is not the router for that. But if you treat it as a main router and add dedicated access points later, it works perfectly.

Personally, I see this as a router first and a WiFi device second, and in that role, it does its job well.

## Is It Worth Rp650,000?

In my opinion, yes, absolutely.

For this price, you’re not just buying a router. You’re buying a learning platform. This device grows with your skills. The more you learn, the more useful it becomes.

If you just want a router that works instantly with zero effort, this is probably not for you. But if you want to understand how networks actually work, this router is worth every rupiah.

## Final Thoughts

The MikroTik hAP ac is more than just a home router for me. It’s a gateway into real networking.

It helped me understand concepts that I would never fully learn from consumer routers. It fits perfectly with my journey into networking, servers, and infrastructure.

Would I recommend it? Yes, but only if you’re ready to learn, fail, and try again.

If you are a student, homelab enthusiast, or someone who wants to go deeper into networking, this router is a solid choice.

Welcome to the MikroTik pain club. Totally worth it.
